# DW2SkinApplier

This tool allows the player to change the visuals of Akira and the three Digi-Beetles with different designs created by my artist, KHK. It will work on any version of Digimon World 2 that did not move the model locations of Akira or the three Digi-Beetles; Which currently, none have! So these are compatible with Vanilla, Improvement, Hard Mode, Resurrection, my upcoming mod, and most likely any future mods once they release! Additionally, the functionallity of the tool ensures that the skin changes are compatible with all emulators including Bizhawk, and while untested, should be compatible with real hardware!

Usage details: Open the Disc Image you want to apply the skins to. Then, select either the Akira or Digi-Beetle tab and select what skin(s) you want to use, and apply them! Do the same for the other section, and enjoy the changes! For the Digi-Beetles you can use a preset from the menu, or mix and match any 3 styles you want! Optionally, for Akira you can choose to NOT change the portrait if you'd perfer he stay the default image. You can re-apply skin changes to the same disc image with no issues, if you want to change them later.
